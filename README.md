# Movie Recommendation System 🎥🍿

This repository hosts the implementation of a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their past interactions or expressed interests. Leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based techniques, this system aims to enhance user experiences by providing personalized recommendations.

---

## 📑 **Project Overview**

In the era of overwhelming content availability, finding the right movie can be a challenge. This recommendation system simplifies the process by analyzing user preferences and delivering tailored suggestions. 

### **Features**
- Personalized movie recommendations.
- Hybrid recommendation methods:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user interactions.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Based on movie genres, descriptions, and features.
- Interactive web interface for user input and recommendations.

---

## 🔧 **System Architecture**

### 1. **User Interaction**:
- Input user preferences (e.g., liked movies, genres, or actors).
- View recommended movie lists.

### 2. **Backend Processing**:
- **Data Collection**: User history, movie metadata, and ratings.
- **Feature Extraction**: Genres, cast, keywords, and ratings.
- **Recommendation Engine**:
  - Collaborative filtering (user-user or item-item).
  - Content-based filtering using cosine similarity or NLP techniques.

### 3. **Output**:
- A ranked list of movie suggestions.

## 📚 **Dataset**

The system uses the https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ for training and testing:
- **Movies**: Includes title, genres, and metadata.
- **Ratings**: User-movie interaction data with ratings and timestamps.
